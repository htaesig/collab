# HTA ESIG collaboration space
This  site hosts the collaboration space for the [HTA ESIG](https://htaesig.github.io/).

As a member of the ESIG, you can use [Discussions](https://github.com/htaesig/collab/discussions) on this site to 

- discuss or connect with members of the HTA ESIG
- provide ideas and suggestions for future SIG meetings
- get an overview of active subteams and their work

## Getting access?
To join discussions, you will need a github account. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

## New subteams?
The active subteam listing is managed by the ESIG leads. 

Reach out to us on htasig@psiweb.org if you're a member of the HTA ESIG interested in starting a new subteam (or if you want to discontinue an active subteam).
